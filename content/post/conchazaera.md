I was surfing through Quora with the question [At what age does one start to be old?](https://qr.ae/TW1LO0).  

Then I came across an example of not being old: A 87-year-old artist 'Painting' all her artworks.

That's true. Concha García Zaera uses MS Paint on her Windows 7 desktop to draw beautiful pictures. The best way to appreciate her marvelous efforts is to go through her [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/conchagzaera/).  

This really lightens me up to know such arts actually exist.
