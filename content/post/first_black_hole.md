Scientists at The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration revealed to the public the first picture of what we call a black hole.

The task has been thought to be impossible because of its bizarre nature (light can't escape from it). 

That all changed now.  

From [EHT website](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/),

> The image reveals the black hole at the center of Messier 87 [^1], a massive galaxy in the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster. This black hole resides 55 million light-years from Earth and has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun [^2].

The algorithm to make this possible is due to **Katie Bouman**. Here is her [PhD thesis](https://people.csail.mit.edu/klbouman/pw/papers_and_presentations/thesis.pdf) where she discussed "reconstructing images and video from a computational telescope the size of the Earth, and seeing around corners."

She also gave a TED talk a while ago.

Let's end this with a little joke.

>**Q**: What do you and black hole have in common?  
**A**: Both suck.



[^1]: The shadow of a black hole is the closest we can come to an image of the black hole itself, a completely dark object from which light cannot escape. The black hole’s boundary — the event horizon from which the EHT takes its name — is around 2.5 times smaller than the shadow it casts and measures just under 40 billion km across.

[^2]: Supermassive black holes are relatively tiny astronomical objects — which has made them impossible to directly observe until now. As a black hole’s size is proportional to its mass, the more massive a black hole, the larger the shadow. Thanks to its enormous mass and relative proximity, M87’s black hole was predicted to be one of the largest viewable from Earth — making it a perfect target for the EHT.
